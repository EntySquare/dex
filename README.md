# UNC Protocol - Decentralized Exchange

## Overview

The UNC DEX (Decentralized Exchange) is a smart contract-based automated market maker (AMM) that facilitates the exchange between UNC (Universal Network Coin) tokens and other ERC20 tokens. It uses a constant product formula (x * y = k) to determine exchange rates and provides users with the ability to trade, provide liquidity, earn fees, and participate in yield farming.

## Key Components

1. **UNC Token**: The primary governance and utility token of the protocol
2. **Paired Tokens**: Secondary ERC20 tokens for trading pairs (USDC, USDT, ETH, etc.)
3. **UNCLT (UNC Liquidity Token)**: ERC20 tokens representing liquidity provider shares
4. **Pool Rewards**: Yield farming rewards for liquidity providers

## Token Mechanics

### UNC Token Distribution

1. **Liquidity Mining**: UNC tokens are distributed to liquidity providers as rewards
2. **Trading Fees**: A portion of trading fees is used for UNC token buybacks
3. **Governance**: UNC token holders participate in protocol governance
4. **Staking Rewards**: Users can stake UNC tokens to earn additional yields

## Core Functions

### Trading & Swapping

#### 1. swapUNC (UNC Token to Other Token)

```solidity
function swapUNC(uint _amountIn) external returns (uint amountOut)
```

**Arithmetic:**

1. Calculate fee: `amountInWithFee = _amountIn * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - FEE_NUMERATOR) / FEE_DENOMINATOR`
2. Calculate output: `amountOut = (otherTokenReserve * amountInWithFee) / (uncTokenReserve + amountInWithFee)`

This function uses the constant product formula (x + y = k) to determine the output amount. Trading fees are deducted and distributed to liquidity providers. #### 2. swapToUNC (Other Token to UNC Token)

```solidity
function swapToUNC(uint _amountIn) external returns (uint amountOut)
```

**Arithmetic:**

1. Calculate fee: `amountInWithFee = _amountIn * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - FEE_NUMERATOR) / FEE_DENOMINATOR`
2. Calculate output: `amountOut = (uncTokenReserve * amountInWithFee) / (otherTokenReserve + amountInWithFee)`

This function allows users to buy UNC tokens with other tokens, supporting the UNC ecosystem growth.

### Liquidity Pool Management

#### 3. addLiquidity (Provide Liquidity)

```solidity
function addLiquidity(uint _uncTokenAmount, uint _otherTokenAmount) external returns (uint shares)
```

**Arithmetic:**

1. If total supply is 0:
   `shares = sqrt(_uncTokenAmount * _otherTokenAmount)`
2. If total supply > 0:
   ```
   uncTokenShare = (_uncTokenAmount * totalSupply) / uncTokenReserve
   otherTokenShare = (_otherTokenAmount * totalSupply) / otherTokenReserve
   shares = min(uncTokenShare, otherTokenShare)
   ```

Liquidity providers receive UNCLT tokens representing their pool share and earn trading fees plus UNC rewards.

#### 4. removeLiquidity (Remove Liquidity)

```solidity
function removeLiquidity(uint _shares) external returns (uint _uncTokenAmount, uint _otherTokenAmount)
```

**Arithmetic:**

1. Calculate UNC token amount: `_uncTokenAmount = (_shares * uncTokenReserve) / totalSupply`
2. Calculate other token amount: `_otherTokenAmount = (_shares * otherTokenReserve) / totalSupply`

This function calculates the proportional amounts to return to liquidity providers based on their pool share.

### Yield Farming & Rewards

#### 5. claimRewards (Claim Liquidity Mining Rewards)

```solidity
function claimRewards() external returns (uint rewardAmount)
```

Liquidity providers can claim accumulated UNC token rewards based on their pool participation and duration.

#### 6. stakeLPTokens (Stake LP Tokens for Additional Rewards)

```solidity
function stakeLPTokens(uint _amount) external
```

Users can stake their UNCLT tokens to earn additional UNC rewards and participate in governance.

## Price Functions & Analytics

### 7. getUNCTokenPrice

```solidity
function getUNCTokenPrice() public view returns (uint)
```

**Arithmetic:** `return (otherTokenReserve * PRECISION) / uncTokenReserve`

Calculates the current market price of UNC token in terms of the paired token.

### 8. getOtherTokenPrice

```solidity
function getOtherTokenPrice() public view returns (uint)
```

**Arithmetic:** `return (uncTokenReserve * PRECISION) / otherTokenReserve`

Calculates the price of the paired token in terms of UNC tokens.

### 9. estimateUNCToOtherToken

```solidity
function estimateUNCToOtherToken(uint uncTokenAmount) public view returns (uint)
```

**Arithmetic:**

1. Apply fee: `amountWithFee = uncTokenAmount * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - FEE_NUMERATOR) / FEE_DENOMINATOR`
2. Estimate output: `return (otherTokenReserve * amountWithFee) / (uncTokenReserve + amountWithFee)`

Provides price estimates for trading UNC tokens, helping users calculate slippage.

### 10. estimateOtherTokenToUNC

```solidity
function estimateOtherTokenToUNC(uint otherTokenAmount) public view returns (uint)
```

**Arithmetic:**

1. Apply fee: `amountWithFee = otherTokenAmount * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - FEE_NUMERATOR) / FEE_DENOMINATOR`
2. Estimate output: `return (uncTokenReserve * amountWithFee) / (otherTokenReserve + amountWithFee)`

Estimates UNC tokens received for a given amount of paired tokens.

## Fee Structure & Distribution

The protocol implements a multi-tier fee system:

- **Trading Fees**: 0.3% on all swaps
  - 0.25% to liquidity providers
  - 0.05% for UNC token buybacks
- **Withdrawal Fees**: 0.1% on liquidity removal (first 30 days)
- **Performance Fees**: 10% on yield farming rewards

## Yield Farming & Incentives

### Liquidity Mining Program

- **Base APR**: 15-25% in UNC tokens for LP providers
- **Boosted APR**: Up to 50% for UNC token stakers
- **Time Multiplier**: Longer positions earn higher multipliers
- **Volume Bonus**: High-volume traders earn additional rewards

### Governance & Staking

- **Governance Rights**: UNC token holders vote on protocol parameters
- **Staking Rewards**: Additional yield for staking UNC tokens
- **Fee Sharing**: Stakers receive a portion of protocol revenue
- **Buyback Program**: Regular UNC token buybacks from trading fees

## Automated Market Maker (AMM) Model

The UNC DEX uses the constant product formula: `x * y = k`

Where:
- x: Reserve of UNC token
- y: Reserve of paired token  
- k: Constant product

This formula ensures that the product of reserves remains constant after each trade, creating a price curve that automatically adjusts based on supply and demand dynamics.

## Liquidity Provider Tokens (UNCLT)

UNCLT tokens represent a liquidity provider's proportional share of the pool. They are:
- **Minted** when liquidity is added to pools
- **Burned** when liquidity is removed from pools
- **Stakeable** for additional UNC rewards
- **Transferable** ERC20 tokens with their own market value

## Pool Analytics & Metrics

The protocol tracks comprehensive pool analytics:
- **Total Value Locked (TVL)**
- **24h Trading Volume**
- **APR/APY for liquidity providers**
- **Price impact for trades**
- **Impermanent loss tracking**
- **Fee collection statistics**

## Security Features

1. **Slippage Protection**: Automatic revert on excessive price impact
2. **Reentrancy Guards**: Protection against reentrancy attacks
3. **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions for administrative functions
4. **Emergency Pause**: Circuit breaker for emergency situations
5. **Time Locks**: Delays for critical parameter changes
6. **Multi-signature**: Requirements for sensitive operations
