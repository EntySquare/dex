# Liquidity Withdrawal Transaction Fix

## Problem Summary
The "Remove Liquidity" function was failing with "execution reverted" errors due to incorrect parameter calculation and data structure issues.

## Root Cause Analysis
The main issue was that the `WithdrawLiquidityDialog` component was incorrectly using the formatted `liquidity` display string as the withdrawal amount, rather than the actual LP shares from the user's position data.

### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Amount Calculation**: The dialog was parsing the formatted `liquidity` string (e.g., "1.23K") and converting it to BigInt with arbitrary scaling (×1e18)
2. **Wrong Data Type**: The `liquidity` field is a formatted display value, not the actual contract shares
3. **Single Bin Limitation**: Only using the active bin ID instead of all bins where the user has liquidity
4. **Missing Raw Data**: No access to the actual shares per bin for contract calls

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced UserPosition Interface
Added `binData` field to store raw contract data:
```typescript
export interface UserPosition {
  // ...existing fields...
  binData: Array<{
    binId: number
    shares: bigint
    totalShares: bigint
    reserveX: bigint
    reserveY: bigint
  }>
}
```

### 2. Updated Position Data Collection
Modified `useUserPositions` hook to store raw bin data alongside formatted display values:
```typescript
binData: userBins.map(bin => ({
  binId: bin.id,
  shares: bin.shares,
  totalShares: bin.totalShares,
  reserveX: bin.reserveX,
  reserveY: bin.reserveY
}))
```

### 3. Fixed Withdrawal Logic
Updated `WithdrawLiquidityDialog` to use actual shares:

#### Full Withdrawal:
- Uses actual `bin.shares` for each bin
- Supports multiple bins per position
- No arbitrary scaling or parsing

#### Partial Withdrawal:
- Calculates proportional shares: `(bin.shares * percentage) / 100`
- Maintains precision with BigInt operations
- Applies percentage to each bin individually

### 4. Enhanced Validation & Error Handling
- Validates bin data availability
- Checks for zero amounts before contract call
- Improved error messages for different failure scenarios
- Better logging for debugging

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `/src/dex/hooks/types.ts` - Added `binData` to UserPosition interface
2. `/src/dex/hooks/useUserPositions.ts` - Store raw bin data in position objects  
3. `/src/components/pool/WithdrawLiquidityDialog.tsx` - Use actual shares for withdrawal

### Technical Improvements:
- **Multi-bin Support**: Handles positions spanning multiple bins
- **Precise Calculations**: Uses actual BigInt shares instead of parsed strings
- **Better Validation**: Comprehensive checks before contract interaction
- **Enhanced UX**: Shows active bin count and range in UI

## Expected Results
- ✅ **Transaction Success**: Remove liquidity calls should now execute successfully
- ✅ **Accurate Amounts**: Withdrawal amounts match actual user shares
- ✅ **Multi-bin Support**: Properly handles complex LB positions
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages for different failure scenarios

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test partial withdrawal (25%, 50%, 75%) on positions with multiple bins
2. Test full withdrawal on both single-bin and multi-bin positions
3. Verify withdrawn amounts match expected proportions
4. Test error scenarios (insufficient balance, network issues)

## Next Steps
1. Test the fix on BSC Testnet with real positions
2. Monitor transaction success rates
3. Gather user feedback on withdrawal experience
4. Consider adding transaction confirmation dialogs for large withdrawals
